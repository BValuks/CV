## Skills

#### Teamwork

I have been lucky enough throughout my career to work in teams of all sizes, and what these experiences have taught me is just what is possible when every member of a team is encouraged to contribute and learn from others. I genuinely enjoy working with others; camaraderie and support are always great motivators for creating high-quality projects. The Makers course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively.

This came into play during our Makers Final Project, where I encouraged other quieter members to offer their thoughts and present my own. I also solidified my skills by either providing leadership or encouraging and supporting others who lead, depending on the team's needs.

#### Management skills and Leadership

In every role I have had, I have always looked for opportunities for progression and this has lead me to hold a number of managerial positions. This culminated in me taking the role of Duty Manager/Team Leader at The Natural History Museum. As well as leading the Visitor Experience team, as Duty Manager I was required to manage the needs of the museum, ensuring the safety of all the staff and the public whilst the building was open. I needed to be aware of health and safety protocols, including evacuation duties, and I needed to liase with both internal teams across the museum as well as external vendors as needed. One of my biggest professional achievements was managing the museum on the busiest January day on record, when 22,000 people came through our doors.
